# Lecture 0 - What is Computer architecture?
## What is Computer Architecture?
* Using comptuers to solve clients' needs.
##W hat is Computer Science?
* Problem solving
	* Algorithms
* Solving problems using computers.
	* Must be correct
	* Must be efficient
		* O(n) instead of O(n^2)
	* Must be **secure**
	* Lots happens in between
	* What do you do to help solve problem?
		* Break it into smaller pieces
## Abstraction is fundamental
* **Abstraction layers**
	* Problem -> (Application, Algorithm, Programming Language)
	* Between -> OS/Compilers -> (ISA, Microarchitecture, Gates/RTL)
	* **Computer architecture is concerned with ISA, Microarchitecture and Gates/RTL from above**
	* Computer -> (Circuits/Devices, Physics)

## Why study computer architecture
* Will this course help get a job?
	* Yes because,
		* of ubiquity of computing devices
			* IoT & microcomputers
			* We will focus on CPU
		* it will make us better programmers
			* What does it mean to be a good programmer?
				* Readability (extensible)
				* Reusability
				* **Be able to write efficient code**
				* **Debug faster**
					* Should master one debugging tool (IDE debugger, GDB)
				* **Computer Architecture can help with the bold**
		* It's a big deal, safer
			* Think about the Spectre-Meltdown. Intel fix slowed down CPUs.

## What problems do computer architects deal with? - History
### 1 First computers used mechanical gears.

* No abstraction
* Computation hardwired
* One person can build it. Not a lot of work for architectures
### 2 Vacuum Tubes 
* Storage issues
* Space issues
* Reliability issues
	* Tubes and memory technology
		* Redundancy was a temporary solution
* John von Neumann seperated computation & storage. (Fundamental design decision, still holds today)
* Input -> Computation -> Output
### 3 Transistors
* Small and low-power usage
* More reliability
* Introduction of high level languages
* Focus on ISA
	* Machines are getting more complex
	* Finally hiding complexity from programmer (Abstraction)
* 1957 first high level language, FORTRAN
### 4 Integrated Circuits
* Cram millions, then billions of transistors into chip
* Issues
	* Memory capacity and speed
		* Cache, VM
		* (Perhaps term project on caches)
	* Extensive ISAs
		* x86, RISC
		* ISA:= Defines what you can execute on processor
	* ILP: functional units, pipelining
		* ILP:= Instruction Level Parallelism
## Today, 5th generation
* **Moore's law** lasted for about 50 years.
* We are not really following Moore's law today.
* **Dennard Scaling**
	* Invented DRAM
	* Increase in power for a fixed chip area is constant as more transistors are added
		* Power icnreased linearly, power linearly
	* **flaw:** Ignored "leakage current" and "threshold voltage"
	* Paper retracted
	* If power increases too much, chips will get much too hot.
* We can add more transistors, but heat is not managable.
* Energy efficiency is becomming more important, server farms.
## Shift to multicore era
* Currently, we keep transisotrs the same, but add more processors called processing cores.
* Hyperthreading are pseudocores
* **Why is this important for us?**
	* We now have to write different code at all levels to take advantage of multi-core processors.
