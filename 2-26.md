# Lecture 4 - Computer Arithmetic

### Thinking in Binary
* All data represented in on/off
* How to get negatives?
	* Using first big as sign bit (1 = negative, 0 = positive)
		* Eg. 0111 = 7, 1000 = -0, 1111 = -7, 1010 = -2
		* Results in two 0s, makes arithmetic difficult.
	* Two's Complement
		* **Invert all bits THEN add 1.**
		* 5 = 0101 , invert = 1010, -5 = 1011
		* 6 = 0110 , invert = 1001, -6 = 1010
		* Modern systems use this.

### Boolean Algebra
* **Like Discrete Math**
	* Truth tables
	* Proof by exhaustion
	* Proof by contradiction

### Gate math
* Use XOR to add
* 0000 01111 + 0000 0110 = 0000 1101
* Use a "Carry in-out" to detect 1+1 (which will add 1 to the next place value)
* Problem, how do we do it? It would need to be more sequential.
	* We use pipelining, which will be discussed later in the semester
* Overflow occurs if there are not enough bits, eg. 1000 + 1000 = ?

### Overflow
* When adding two different sings operation will never overflow.
* If subtracting two operands with same sign, overflow won't occur.
	* **Signed Arithmetic**
		* To detect overflow, if adding two positives gives (-), overflow
		* Inverse is also true.

### Representing Big (and small) numbers
* NO matter the size, there is always a need for a bigger, (or smaller) number
* Some might not be big or small, but require lots of space
	* Pi, e
* Scientific Notation
	* 0.00000000000000001 = 1.0e-27
	* Avogardo's Number = 6.02e23
	* General Format = (-1)sign x Fractional x 10<sup>exponent</sup>
	* For binary it becomes = (-1)sign x fractional x 2<sup>exponent</sup>
* Binary Representation
	* sign (1 bit) Exponent (variable bits) Fraction (variable bits)
		* e.g. 1.45 = 0 * (1.45) * 2<sup>0</sup>
	* Trade-off for mantissa (Range vs. Precision)
	* Floating point standard for exponent vs range
		* **Single**, 8 bits exponent, 23 bits fraction (mantissa)
		* **Double**, 11 bits, 52 bits
		* **Sign**, 0 = (+), 1 = (-)
	* To store, add bias to exponent, if exponent is 3, store 3 + 127
	* excess representation, ensured exponent is unsigned.
		* **Bias**, Single bias = 127, double bias = 1023
	* To read, subtract bias from exponent
