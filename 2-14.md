# Adding Control to Datapath
* At any given cycle
	* tell each MUX which to select
	* tell ALUs operation to perform
	* let registers know if it's a read/write
* Need to add HW for all of these

# ALU Control
* 0 - AND
* 1 OR
* 2 ADD
* 3 SUBSTRACT

* Considering that different operations take different amount of times, there can be a lot of waste when we have uniform cycles.
* We can fix by
	* Fetching and executing more than one instruction at a time.
	* Use SW and HW techniques for exploiting ILP.
	* Pipelining
		* Modern processors are optimized for this
	*
