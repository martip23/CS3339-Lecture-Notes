# ISA (Lecture 2)

## Review
* ISA (Tell compiler what it needs to know.
* Describe Hardware
* Description of ISA and implementation go hand-in-hand.
* Types of ISA
* Need list of instructions to write for hardware
	* Arithmetic, Branch, Memory
	* Enough to execute any program written in high-level language

## Instruction Encoding

### Immediate Instructions
* Small constants are used often in typical code
	* What's the most common constant used in Assembly programs?
	* Put "Typical Constants" in memory and load them.
	* Create hard-wired registers
		* Taking up valuable registers
	* Have special instructions that contain constants
		* Immediate Instructions, constant is kept inside intruction itself.
	* What is the largest int constant we can use in C
		* 2^32 maybe larger
	* How many bits to represent this? 32.
	* Size of instruction will take other space
* Solution is to use two instructions
	* Loads immediate value into upper, and lower bit
	* lui, ori.
	
### Memory Instructions
#### Registers
* Tiny memory in CPU
	* PC, Program Counter/ Instruction Pointer
	* SP, Stack Pointer
	* FP, Frame Pointer
	* ZERO on MIPS
* Can be faster than 1 clock cycle
* Range of registers between 8-64
	* Itanium is an exception
	* Actual implementations may have higher # of registers
	* Easier for compilers to use
	* Can do multiplications in any order (as opposed to a stack or accumulator)
* What are problems with having lots of registers?
	* More bits to address
	* Physical space on processor
	* Larger memory takes longer to find
		* It is RAM, but there is still an overhead
		* We may not be able to maintain this 1-cycle latency
		* Same theory applies to memory, disk, anything we search
	* Increase in read/write port impacts speed quadratically
	* Power considerations
###### Spilling Registers
* If program needs more registers, there is spilling
	* Project Idea - Measure number of register spills and associated costs in two different ISAs or two different compilers
* Spilling Registers is the need to store value in memory temporarily
