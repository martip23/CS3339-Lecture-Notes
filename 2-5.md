# ISA (Lecture 2)

## Review
* ISA (Tell compiler what it needs to know.
* Describe Hardware
* Description of ISA and implementation go hand-in-hand.
* Types of ISA
* Need list of instructions to write for hardware
	* Arithmetic, Branch, Memory
	* Enough to execute any program written in high-level language

## Instruction Encoding

### Immediate Instructions
* Small constants are used often in typical code
	* Put "Typical Constants" in memory and load them.
	* Create hard-wired registers
		* Taking up valuable registers
	* Have special instructions that contain constants
		* Immediate Instructions, constant is kept inside intruction itself.
	* What is the largest int constant we can use in C
		* 2^32 maybe larger
	* How many bits to represent this? 32.
	* Size of instruction will take other space
* Solution is to use two instructions
	* Loads immediate value into upper, and lower bit
	* lui, ori.
* What's the most common constant used in Assembly programs?
	
### Memory Instructions
#### Registers
* Tiny memory in CPU
	* PC, Program Counter/ Instruction Pointer
	* SP, Stack Pointer
	* FP, Frame Pointer
	* ZERO on MIPS
* Can be faster than 1 clock cycle
* Range of registers between 8-64
	* Itanium is an exception
	* Actual implementations may have higher # of registers
	* Easier for compilers to use
	* Can do multiplications in any order (as opposed to a stack or accumulator)
* What are problems with having lots of registers?
	* More bits to address
	* Physical space on processor
	* Larger memory takes longer to find
		* It is RAM, but there is still an overhead
		* We may not be able to maintain this 1-cycle latency
		* Same theory applies to memory, disk, anything we search
	* Increase in read/write port impacts speed quadratically
	* Power considerations
###### Spilling Registers
* **Register Pressure** Amount of registers needed fro a specific program
* If program needs more registers, there is spilling
	* Project Idea - Measure number of register spills and associated costs in two different ISAs or two different compilers
* Spilling Registers is the need to store value in memory temporarily
##### Adressing Modes
* Addressing DIstant locations, we can:
	* Add more bits
	* Store address in register
	* Store in multiple instructions
	* THe one that works well is...
###### Indirect addressing mode
* Access instructions and data using an offset from a common base address. Store base address in some register
* How far do we need to jump on a jump?
	* Where do jumps come from?
		* If/else, loops
	* Where do we jump if the test is true?
		* NExt instruction
	* Where do we jump if loop is true?
		* NExt instruction for while and for loops
	* How far do we jump when condition is false?
		* End of loop/if clause
	* How large are loop bodies? if statement?
		* SPEC benchmarks show taht most jumps are within 16 assembly instructions
* **PC Relative Addressing**
	* Most common form of indirect-addressing
		* Embedded jump code in instruction. 
		* PC is current instruction.
			* Get a range of 2^15
		* DOesn't solve problem with jumps entirely
			* E.g. Function calls - Code can be far, far away
	* Adderssable units
		* Can't pick a certain bit. Must get byte.
		* FOr most architectures, you must specify a byte location.
		* Addressable unit may be larger, half word: 2byte, word: 4byte, double word: 8byte
			* **Problem** Need to specify end address.
	* Amount of Data Transfer
		* Can vary in some ISAs
			* Some ISAs support seperate load/store instructions
				* ld -> load one byte
				* lw -> load one word
				* ldd -> load two words
		* In reality, never bring one or two words from memory
		* There is a locality benefit
	* Alignment
		* Some architectures restrict data for different structures
			* Hal-Words only at even addresses
			* Words only at multiples of 4
	* Word
		* 4 bytes (usually)
		* Can vary on other machines Sometimes 2 bytes or 64
	* 32-bit vs 64-bit
		* Features and Components that differ
			* Addressable Locations 2^64, 2^32
			* Register size
			* Instruction Length
			* OS and Compilers exploit differences
			* Coding
		* **Benefits**
			* Address a larger range of bits.
			* Performance benefits are not that great.
	* Endianness
		* Little endian : Most significant byte at highest address
		* Big endian	: Most significant byte at lowest address
	* Data Types
		* Handling Data Types
			* Tags to determine type (float vs int)
			* Wastes space
	* Control instruction implementation
		* Solution: Subtract -> Flags: Zero Negative Carry Overflow

### Conditional Branching
* Two tasks
	* Evaluate Condition
	* Jump to new address based on result
* For compare, subtract, 
	* GP register will be 0, negative, zero or carry
