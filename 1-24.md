# Evaluating Performance

## Review from 1-22
* The multi-core era
	* Moved to multi-core due to increasing heat.
	* Single core is easier to develop for.
	* No benefit unless program is programmed for concurrency.
* Speedup
	* ExecutionTimeY / ExecutionTimeX
	* Bigger is better.

## Workloads and benchmarks
* Benchmarks - Specially selected programs to compare performance
* Workloads - Set of programs that represent collection of applications that may be run on a system.
* Not idea, but best we have.
* **Project idea** Get a benchmark suite and evaluate performance
	* 1 core vs 2 core vs 4 core CPU
	* vs GPU

## Axiom 5 - Summarizing performance is hard
* Comparing and summarizing performance is tricky, even if we have accurate measurements
	* Arithmetic mean
	* Geometric mean
		* What we want to use for ratios
	* Harmonic mean
		* Good to average rates (throughput)
		* Mitigates effect of outliers

## Axiom 6 - REalistic Expectation
* Cannot expect an enhancement in one aspect to have a proportional improvement on overall performance.
* Speedup = ExecTime old / ExecTime new = 10/8 = 1.25
* Estimating potential speedup
	* How good is optimization (s)
	* How frequently is it applied (p)
	* ExTime new = (ExTime old * p * 1/s) + (ExTimeold * (1-p))
	* Speedup = 1/((1-p) + (p/s))
	* P is decimal from percent.
	* S is speedup.
	* **Achievable speedup is bounded by amount the improved feature is used**
		* Make the common case fast
		* Look for ways to exploit parallelism.
		* Can be used with previous formula

## Reporting performance
* Be honest
* List
	* Version of OS
	* Compiler settings
	* Input set used
	* Specific computer config
	* Clock rate
	* Cache sizes and speed
	* Memory size and speed
	* [...]
