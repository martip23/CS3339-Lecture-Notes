#Lecture 1 - Evaluating Performance

### Lecture 0 - Review
* Class will be difficult because Qasem has high expectations for Texas State and students.
* Computer architecture
	* Organization and design of computer systems
	* Care about efficiency and correctness(and security)
	* Abstraction layers: Software and Hardware
* Importance of studying Computer Architecture today
* Role of tech in Computer Architecture

## von Neumann Architecture
* See PPT slide

## How fast is your computer?
* Not fast, but efficient
###What metrics to look at?
* Exectuion time
* Speedup
* CPU time
* clock rate
* cycle count
* cpi
* instruction count
* **Often make a qualitative statment based on results

###Two perspectives
* Buyer perspective
	* Best performance
	* least cost
	* best cost/performance
* Architect perspective
	* Same as above
	* + manufacturing cost
	* + **Physical space on chip**
	* Possible question on exam
		* Given this exhancement to processor arch discuss performance cost trade-offs
			* One of first things to think of is SPACE
	* Our goal is to undestsand what factors in the arch contribute to overall system performance and relative importance (and cost) of these factors.
	* Cost vs Performance
* Statistics are tricky

## Axioms of evaluation
* Bigger is better
	* Bigger (Higher) is better
	* Not for execution time
	* Performance = 1/execution_time
* THere are no absolutes
	* Absolute performance doesn't say much
	* For example, "It takes 300ms to launch SKype on a MacBOok Pro" doesn't mean much to us.
	* These are barely useful
	* We should use a **baseline** configuration
	* Ratio when we improve baseline is called **speedup**
	* In this class, speedup is a very specific term. 
	* Performance_x / performance_y = executionTime_y / executionTime_x = n
* More (see PPT)

##Defining Performance
* Exectuion time:= the time between start and completion of a task
	* aka response time, wall clock time
* Typicall task is a program
* typical tasks
	* Boot time (evaulating OS)
	* Launch time
