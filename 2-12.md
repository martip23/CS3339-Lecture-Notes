### Review
* Addressing modes
* Data layout in memory
	* Stack
	* Heap
	* Offsets from SP
* 32-bit vs 64-bit 
* Endianness
* Conditional branch implementation
* **CPU performance**
	* Two forms
		* CPU Time = IC * CPI * Clock Cycle Time
		* CPU Time = (instructions/program) * (Cycles/Instruction) * (Seconds/Cycle)
	* Architects want to reduce CPU Time
	* 

# RISC vs CISC
## CISC (Complex Instruction Set COmputing)
* REducing IC with more complex instructions.
	* If each instruction does more, then need fewer instructions
	* TEnds to increase CPI but decrase IC
	* Older system
	* MIPS, RISC-I
	* **Single Cycle Execution**
	* **Load/Store architecture**
	* **Few memory addressing modes**
	* **Fixed-length instruction format**
	* **eEliance on compiler optimizations**
	* **Many registers**
## RISC (Reduced ....)
* Improve CPI with many SIngle Sycle instructions
* INcreases IC but hopefully not as much
	* Help from smart compiler
* (perhaps)Improve clock cycle via aggressive implementation allowed by simpler instructions 
* Pipelining
## History
* Pre 1975 - Bad Compilers, Complex, high-level ISAs
* 1975 - Compilers had to get involved in a big way
## Current Winner (Revenue): CISC
* AMD, Intel
* RISC inside
* Intel actually runs like RISC
## Winner (Volume): RISC
* ARM Processor
	* Acorn RISC Machine ! Advanced RISC Machine
	* 32-bit RISC ISA
	* Multiple implementations

# MIPS overcview
* Project ideas
	* Write a simulator fora  MIPS-like architecture
	* Add a feature of your choice and evaluate
* Resources
	* Green insert in TExt front cover
	* Overview of ISA
## What features of MIPS should we be interested in?
* Types of instructions
* Addressing Modes
* Registers
* Instruction Length
* Instruction Encoding
* Number of operands
* Supported Data Types

# Processor Datapath
## Implementation of ALU, Memory, Branch, Control Unit
**Microarchitectual Perspective** A little **Gates/RTL**

## Datapath & Control
* Datapath, set of components to combine to execute an instruction
* Control, Set of components that tell datapath what to do
* Classification is somewhat arbitrary
* Datapath and Control combine to provide a processor implementation
* Not use HDL in this class
### Datapath Elements: ALU
**Adders are ALUs hardwired to do addition**
### Datapath Elements: Multiplexer(MUX)
* 2 -> 1
### Datapath Elements: Registers
### Datapath Elements: Memory
* L1 Cache: Closest to processor
* Slower than registers, faster than main memory
	* 2-10 cycles per load
* (multiple)read/(one)write/address ports

## Processor Implementation
* Implementing all instructions for a given ISA
* Different instructions may have different resource requirements
* Requirements for the same class of instructions will be similar
* Some tasks we need to perform for every instruction
# Fetch -> Decode -> Execute -> Fetch next...
## Fetch Unit
* Fetch instruction from memory and handoff
* Components needed:
	* Memory
	* ALU
	* PC (IC)
## Instruction Decode
* Determining opcode, extraction register #, extracting memory address
* Just a matter of redirecting wires
* **Load means get value from memory, put into register**
* **Vice versa for store**
