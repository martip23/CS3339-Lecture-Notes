#Lecture 1 - Evaluating Performance

### Lecture 0 - Review
* Class will be difficult because Qasem has high expectations for Texas State and students.
* Computer architecture
	* Organization and design of computer systems
	* Care about efficiency and correctness(and security)
	* Abstraction layers: Software and Hardware
* Importance of studying Computer Architecture today
* Role of tech in Computer Architecture

## von Neumann Architecture
* See PPT slide

## How fast is your computer?
* Not fast, but efficient
###What metrics to look at?
* Exectuion time
* Speedup
* CPU time
* clock rate
* cycle count
* cpi
* instruction count
* **Often make a qualitative statment based on results

###Two perspectives
* Buyer perspective
	* Best performance
	* least cost
	* best cost/performance
* Architect perspective
	* Same as above
	* + manufacturing cost
	* + **Physical space on chip**
	* Possible question on exam
		* Given this exhancement to processor arch discuss performance cost trade-offs
			* One of first things to think of is SPACE
	* Our goal is to undestsand what factors in the arch contribute to overall system performance and relative importance (and cost) of these factors.
	* Cost vs Performance
* Statistics are tricky

## Axioms of evaluation
* 1 - Bigger is better
	* Bigger (Higher) is better
	* Not for execution time
	* Performance = 1/execution_time
* 2 - There are no absolutes
	* Absolute performance doesn't say much
	* For example, "It takes 300ms to launch SKype on a MacBOok Pro" doesn't mean much to us.
	* These are barely useful
	* We should use a **baseline** configuration
	* Ratio when we improve baseline is called **speedup**
	* In this class, speedup is a very specific term. 
	* PerformanceX / performanceY = executionTimeY / executionTimeX = n
* 3 - Many different factors affect performance
	* Think about hard drive speed vs CPU speed.
	* Focusing on the CPU
		* Time CPU spends working on a task.
		* Does not include I/O eg. hard disk, memory
		* Not easy to measure accurately
	* Clock cycle
		* On modern machines measured in picoseconds 10^-12
		* The smaller the clock cycle the faster the machine
		* **Clock rate is inverse to clock cycle**
	* CPU Execution Time
		* # of CPU cycles for program x clock cycle time
		* # of CPU cycles for program / clock rate
	* CPI (Clock cycles per instruction) (to get CPU Execution Time)
		* # CPU clcok cycles for a program = # of Instructions for program x Average clock clock cycles per instruction
		* **THis is the area comptuer architects are concenredn with.**
		* _violates bigger is better_
		* Dynamic vs Static Instruction
			* Dynamic is code actaully run 
			* Static is assembly code
			* **Why are they drastically different?** A: Jumps and loops
		* Probably better to use Dynamic over Static instruction count
		* Branch prediction can help Branch instructions
	* We can sometimes run two ALU instructions at the same time
		* ILP - Instruction Level Parallelism
* More (see PPT)

##Defining Performance
* Exectuion time:= the time between start and completion of a task
	* aka response time, wall clock time
* Typicall task is a program
* typical tasks
	* Boot time (evaulating OS)
	* Launch time
